# ExpressHasuraAPI

Two APIs SignIn and SignUp
Hasura GraphQL Engine is used for the project so you dont need to add a DB its already in cloud
The passwords are hashed and stored in DB
The Registration Number should be 15 character or more
The cloud table is empty so please add some data using signUp function to check all edge cases

The front End for the server is in another repo https://github.com/White-Vulpes/SimpleYetBeautiful

Hope you like my project..
